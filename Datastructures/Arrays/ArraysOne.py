# Arrays are  a special variable that holds more than One Value AT A TIME 

# Instead of having two seperate variables AnimalOne = 'Girafee', and AnimalTwo = 'Hippo'
# We can fit many different animals stored into an array
african_animals = ['Giraffe', 'Hippo', 'Rattle-Snake','Rabbit','Hare','Warthog','Cheetah','Lion','Termite']

# Arrays start at 0, to Access the first element we do it like: african_animals[0] (This will be Giraffe)

# Practice ONE: #Using the Array
    # Create a String Variable that will say "Hippos, and Giraffes are the biggest animals in the god damn fooking AF-ER-ICA" and print it

num_of_Rattle_Snakes = 5

# Practice TWO: #Using the Array
    # Use Type casting to create a Variable and Print a String "There are 5 Rattle-Snakes here" 


# Arrays can be added together by: array_one + array_two

northamerican_animals = ['Bear','Skunk','Racoon','Beaver','Trump','Walid']

# Practice THREE: #Using the Array
    # Create a new array called animals by combining both arrays together and print it
